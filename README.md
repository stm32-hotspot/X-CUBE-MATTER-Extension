# X-Cube-Matter 1.4 extension

This package is based on the X-Cube-Matter 1.4 firmware ([package](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-matter.html)).
It is extending the portfolio of supported boards with the NUCLEO-WBA65RI.
It also extending the range of example applications provided.

Examples in this package (* are available in the original package):
  * Generic switch *
  * Lighting *
  * Lock
  * Smart plug (with power consumption reporting)
  * Temperature sensor
  * Thermostat
  * Window covering *
  * Matter bridge *

Each example project has its own Readme.txt file with description and details on how to operate the application.

**STM32Cube** is a STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform (this repo), delivered for each series (such as the STM32CubeU5 for the STM32U5 series).
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware libraries
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A development with three Toolchains and Compilers (IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM (EWARM), RealView Microcontroller Development Kit (MDK-ARM), and STM32CubeIDE).

The **X-CUBE-MATTER expansion Package** projects are directly running on the STM32WB, STM32WBA6 and STM32H7 series boards. You can find in each Projects/Board name directories a set of software projects (Applications, Demonstration, Examples).
